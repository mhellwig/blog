            </div>
            <h1>Intro (what is this about)</h1>
<p>So for a long time I've had an <a href="https://xmpp.org">XMPP</a> (historically also
known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabber">Jabber</a>) account on
<a href="http://web.jabber.ccc.de">jabber.ccc.de</a>. There are a lot of reasons for
preferring xmpp over other protocols for instant messaging but I don't
really feel like repeating stuff that has been said a million times.</p>
<p>Anyway, long after most other people I got myself a smartphone 3 years
ago and ever since have struggled with the fact that even though in
theory, xmpp <em>should</em> be much greater than all the closed alternatives, in
reality and for mobile use it often isn't, which is why one can evangelise
all one wants, people will continue using e.g. WhatsApp not just because
of ignorance but because, sadly, it just works. </p>
<p>Now what do I mean by "it just works": It is well known that
security-wise, WhatsApp is a nightmare, but, and this is an important
point, messages reach their destination most of the time, and if they
don't, there is some way the user finds out about that.</p>
<p>The problem with the open version of mobile xmpp (I presume WhatsApp is
just some kind of modified xmpp internally) is that this isn't the case
here.</p>
<p>A scenario. Alice wants to talk to Bob. Alice might be sitting in front of
her computer or use her mobile phone, it doesn't matter, what matters is
Bob is using his mobile phone. Now if Alice sends a message and Bob loses
his network connectivity for a few seconds before receiving this message,
the message is just lost when using xmpp. This comes as a surprise to a
lot of people, since after all, xmpp is TCP/IP based, but it is still the
case, since xmpp doesn't use any confirmation mechanism. This is, afaict,
because the standard was written at a time when it was thought that the
main use would be users that are all connected to the server via short,
high-speed LANs, probably in the same building or so. Also, it takes a
while for an xmpp server to realise that one of its users has dropped off
the net, so Alice might see a that Bob has logged off .. but that will
happen up to 15 minutes <em>after</em> he actually lost connectivity.</p>
<p>Bob might come back online after a few seconds, but, this is the awful
part, neither the server nor Alice will ever know that he never received
the message that was sent while he was away (because neither even saw that
he was away). And if Bob has his mobile phone in his pocket he will also
not notice. So there might be messages before and after the lost message
that he does receive. It can become quite confusing.</p>
<p>There are extensions to the XMPP protocol which are labelled
"XEP-something" where "something" is a number. Those extensions (there are
quite a lot of them) are listed at
<a href="https://xmpp.org/xmpp-protocols/xmpp-extensions/">this link</a>. Some of those were
created explicitly with the goal of solving the problem I describe above.
The first interesting one here is <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0184.html">XEP-0184: Message Delivery
Receipts</a> which allows clients
to tell each other "yep, got that message". But the most important one is
<a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0198.html">XEP-0198: Stream Management</a>,
which allows a client to tell the server "oh hey, I was gone for a few
seconds/minutes there, got any messages for me?"</p>
<h1>Overview of the current situation</h1>
<p>So, case closed, right? Everybody implements XEP-0198 in their software
and things are peachy!</p>
<p>Well no. Because they don't. Implement it, that is.</p>
<p>For this to work, the client (the app on the mobile phone) as well as the
server have to support XEP-0198.</p>
<h2>daemon software</h2>
<p>In the server world, the situation is:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.process-one.net/en/ejabberd/">ejabberd</a>, written in
  <a href="http://www.erlang.org">Erlang</a> claims to be the "worlds most popular
  XMPP application server". Offers its own version of "mobile support",
  but only in the non-free "Enterprise Edition". The Open Source
  "Community Edition" has neither that proprietory implementation nor
  XEP-0198. A full breakdown of the XEPs that are supported is
  <a href="http://www.process-one.net/en/ejabberd/protocols/">here</a>. There is a
  longstanding bug in the ejabberd <a href="https://support.process-one.net/browse/EJAB-532">issue
  tracker</a> that quite
  clearly shows that the developers are not interested in implementing
  this. <br>
  Note that <a href="http://web.jabber.ccc.de">jabber.ccc.de</a> uses ejabberd.</li>
<li>There is a <a href="https://github.com/xek/ejabberd">fork</a> of ejabberd
  (presumably of the community edition) on <a href="https://github.com">github</a>,
  with the explicit purpose of adding XEP-0198 to ejabberd. The last
  development on this fork seems to have happened three years ago.</li>
<li><a href="https://prosody.im">prosody</a>, written in <a href="http://www.lua.org">Lua</a>, has
  support for XEP-0198 in a
  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/prosody-modules/wiki/mod_smacks">plugin</a> which
  implements part of the spec (namely, what is still missing is the
  possibility for the server to commit lost messages to offline storage,
  currently it only implements the "send an error if receiver is offline
  for a time longer than timeout").</li>
</ul>
<p>There are of course other jabber daemons but those are the ones I looked
at.</p>
<h2>client software</h2>
<h3>mobile clients for Android</h3>
<p>I mainly looked at clients for Android since an Android phone is what I
have access to.</p>
<p>Popular clients include</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.xabber.org/">xabber</a>. Does not support XEP-0198. There is a
  bug in the
  <a href="https://github.com/redsolution/xabber-android/issues/67">xabber-bugtracker</a>
  that doesn't have any comments from developers and isn't assigned to
  anyone.</li>
<li><a href="http://beem-project.com/">beem</a>. Does not support XEP-0198. There is a
  bug in the <a href="http://beem-project.com/issues/400">beem bugtracker</a> which
  was opened two years ago and has no activity beyond being changed from
  "bug" to "feature request" 9 months ago.</li>
<li><a href="https://guardianproject.info/apps/chatsecure/">chatsecure</a>, formerly
  known as Gibberbot, is probably the most feature-complete xmpp-app for
  Android, at least according to its specs. Supports
  <a href="https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/">OTR</a> as well as XEP-0198.</li>
<li><a href="https://yaxim.org">yaxim</a> supports XEP-0198 as well as XEP-0184.</li>
</ul>
<h3>linux clients</h3>
<p>There isn't really any necessity for a client that doesn't use mobile
networking or is stationary to implement XEP-0198, but that doesn't mean
that we can ignore those clients. According to XEP-0198, if a server
detects that a client is gone for good, it may react "by either returning
an error to the sender or committing the stanza to offline storage."</p>
<p>That "error to the sender" is a stanza with the same message-ID as the
original message, no content and is of type="error". One would presume
that a client receiving such an error message would endeavour to inform
its user but alas, this is not the case. I looked at the following
clients:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://bitlbee.org">BitlBee</a> is a gateway that translates various chat
  protocols (including XMPP) to IRC, thereby allowing the user to have
  them all in his/her favourite IRC client.</li>
<li><a href="http://psi-im.org/">psi</a> pure XMPP client, graphical.</li>
<li><a href="http://pidgin.im/">pidgin</a> Multi-IM client, graphical.</li>
</ul>
<h1>my findings</h1>
<p>I used my own ARCH Linux server and installed prosody and the XEP-0198
plugin on it. It has to be noted that the
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/prosody-modules/wiki/mod_smacks">mod_smacks</a>-plugin
currently in <a href="http://aur.archlinux.org">AUR</a> is not the current one and
therefore doesn't work. Installing it by hand is easy, since it's just one
file.  Then I used one account for the desktop clients and one for the
mobile clients to test scenarios of loss of connectivity for different
lengths of time, as well as mobile to mobile chats.</p>
<p>I simulated loss of connectivity on the phone by first deactivating mobile
networking (to take away the fallback option) and then turning off the
wifi. What should happen is that when one re-enables wifi after a short
time, the client should tell the server that he's back from an outage and
should receive queued messages. A remote chat party shouldn't see the
disconnect/reconnect. When the outage goes on for longer (in my tests at
least 10 minutes, up to 15 minutes), the server realises something is
amiss and starts his countdown. After the countdown is over (5 minutes
default), the sender receives an error message from the server.</p>
<h2>sending side</h2>
<p>Of the senders tested (Bitlbee, Psi, Pidgin, Yaxim for mobile to mobile),
initially <em>none</em> showed the error message to the user (see bug reports
below). </p>
<p>Yaxim fixed that bug on the same day and now shows a red cross over the
message concerned as well as an extra message in the chat stream that
reads "recipient-unavailable(-1)" and has a red background.</p>
<p>BitlBee acknowledged the bug on IRC and discussed how they might fix it.
Bitlbee has the problem that up untill now it doesn't generate message IDs
and it is (AFAIK) not easy to change the way a line that has already been
written to the IRC client is displayed after the fact. The discussion went
in the direction of basically putting a timestamp into the message-ID,
thereby allowing a message of the type "your message from 'time' could not
be delivered" to be generated upon error. Since at least one developer has
tested the problem together with me I presume the bug is being worked
upon.</p>
<p>Psi have so far not reacted to the bug report.</p>
<p>Pidgin have so far not reacted to the bug report.</p>
<h2>server side</h2>
<p>Prosody implements XEP-0198 correctly, as far as I can see. Nevertheless,
I would prefer if the second option ("or committing the stanza to offline
storage") were available as well since that would increase comfort for the
user (no need to resend messages). After discussion in the chat with
Prosody developers, I filed a wishlist-bug for this (see below).</p>
<h2>receiving side</h2>
<p>Yaxim works as advertised (after fixing the bug mentioned below and
above). The version that incorporates these bug fixes should make its way
to the Play Store "later this week".</p>
<p>Chatsecure works as advertised some of the time. And then it doesn't. And
then it has trouble reconnecting. And then it takes 5 minutes to
reconnect. And then it sometimes doesn't see contacts as online even
though they clearly are and nothing can make it see the error of its ways.
So even though on paper it should be the best client out there, it made my
blood boil with anger ...</p>
<p>Xabber just plain doesn't support XEP-0198 so no point complaining about
it losing messages. At least it quickly reconnects after connection loss.</p>
<p>Beem is extremely bad in that it not only fails to support XEP-0198, a
loss of connectivity also causes it to display an error message and quit,
not reconnecting automatically. So unless the user intervenes <em>every</em>
<em>single</em> <em>time</em> that connectivity is lost, it won't work at all.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>For now, Yaxim seems to be the best client out there (but be very aware
that it doesn't encrypt your messages end-to-end, so unless you trust all
the servers in between yourself and the recipient to correctly implement
encryption and not store your messages, treat it as unsafe for sensitive
content!). If it supported OTR as well, it would be perfect. The yaxim
bugtracker has a <a href="https://github.com/pfleidi/yaxim/issues/82">bug</a> about
OTR and <a href="https://github.com/pfleidi/yaxim/issues/83">another one</a> about
AGP.</p>
<p>Prosody as server works as advertised. If you don't want to install one
yourself, Yaxim offers an open Prosody server that supports XEP-0198 at
<a href="http://yaxim.org/yax.im/">yax.im</a>.</p>
<p>Chatsecure <em>could</em> be great if they manage to fix all the annoyances
detailed above.</p>
<p>Xabber is no contender unless it implements XEP-0198. Same for Beem.</p>
<p>I did not investigate the situation for iPhones since I don't own or have
access to an iPhone. I would be happy to hear about it though.</p>
